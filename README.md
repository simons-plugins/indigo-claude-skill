# Indigo Plugin Development Skill

Community-maintained Claude Code skill for Indigo home automation plugin development.

## What is This?

This is a Claude Code skill that provides expert assistance for developing [Indigo](https://www.indigodomo.com) home automation plugins. It includes comprehensive documentation, code examples, and best practices maintained by the Indigo developer community.

## Installation

### Option 1: Clone into your project

```bash
cd /path/to/your/indigo/project
mkdir -p .claude/skills
cd .claude/skills
git clone https://github.com/indigo-community/indigo-skill.git indigo
```

### Option 2: Add as submodule

```bash
cd /path/to/your/indigo/project
mkdir -p .claude/skills
git submodule add https://github.com/indigo-community/indigo-skill.git .claude/skills/indigo
```

### Option 3: Symlink (for multiple projects)

```bash
# Clone once
git clone https://github.com/indigo-community/indigo-skill.git ~/indigo-skill

# Symlink in each project
cd /path/to/your/indigo/project
mkdir -p .claude/skills
ln -s ~/indigo-skill .claude/skills/indigo
```

## Usage

Once installed, invoke the skill in Claude Code:

```
/indigo "How do I create a custom device?"
/indigo "Debug this plugin lifecycle issue"
